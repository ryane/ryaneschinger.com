      Are you frustrated by high costs and lack of control when hosting your application on Heroku? Have you been considering making the jump to AWS but are overwhelmed with the various options? Or do you just need some assistance and guidance? I can help you build an AWS infrastructure that is more powerful, flexible, cost-effective and as easy to manage as your existing Heroku setup.

    <p>
      Infrastructure automation and configuration management are fundamental practices that enable you to deliver your ambitious application to market and to scale it as your user base grows. I can help establish your "infrastructure as code" so that your team can focus on what they are best at: solving the problems that matter to your business and your bottom line.

    <p>
      No matter the size of your organization, the benefits of continuous delivery are clear: increased efficiency and flexibility, less risk, and the ability to react more quickly in an ever-changing marketplace. And you don't have to be the next Netflix or Etsy to implement a solid continuous delivery process.

      Reproducible Development Environments
    </h1>
    <p>
      "It works on my machine." Never hear those words again. How much productivity and development time is lost trying to get your application running for a new developer or on a new laptop? I can help get your developers up and running within minutes as opposed to days with reproducible, virtualized development environments.
