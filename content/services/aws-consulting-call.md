## Are you curious whether AWS is a better fit for your application?

Are you frustrated by poor performance, lack of control, and unpredictable deployments? Are you wondering if you are leaving money on the table by hosting your application on Heroku? Or are you just overwhelmed by the sheer number of services AWS provides?

For **$249**, I will meet with your for a **1 hour** consulting session to discuss your application and whether AWS is an option you should be exploring. We will discuss the biggest challenges you are facing with your application, its infrastructure, and how AWS may (or may not) help.

After our call, I will summarize our discussion and provide you with a detailed write-up of recommendations and next steps.
